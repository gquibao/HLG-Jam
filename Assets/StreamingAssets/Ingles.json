Unlike that rat, you’re not a Chef yet. See these things on the table? That's all you need to make the best cake ever, at least that's what I expect from you.",
	"fala2" : "I almost forgot, your payment is based in the amount of correct recipes minus the wrong ones, each day I’m going to ask more of you, so be careful! Let’s start with 10, and don’t feel pressured, but you have to do it all before the clock runs out.  Good luck!",

	"fala3" : "MEOW! You’re doing a great job, but don’t think that your tail is safe yet. As I said, today is going to be harder than yesterday, so be cautious with the clock and amount of cakes you need to bake! I wanna see how you do with 15, keep these paws moving!",
